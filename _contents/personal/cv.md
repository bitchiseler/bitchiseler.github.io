## Research Profile

I am a researcher with a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering whose work focuses on
embedded and real-time systems, robotics middleware, and performance-oriented
system design. My research bridges academic system modeling with production-grade
embedded platforms, including Linux-based SoCs, UAV systems, and GPU-accelerated
simulation.

My work emphasizes system reliability and explainability under real-world
constraints, spanning both academic research and long-term industrial platforms.

## Education

### Ph.D. in Computer & Information Communication Engineering
**Konkuk University**, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)
2010 – 2019
**Dissertation:** GPU-based Parallel LCTM Traffic Simulation Time Prediction
**Abstract:** In this dissertation, we proposed a simulation time prediction method for traffic simulation in a specific region where new traffic demand is expected in order to enhance the performance of the traffic simulation and to obtain the reduction of execution time in the simulation. The results of parallel traffic simulation were compared and verified with the mathematical temporal prediction model using the LCTM (Lane Cell Transmission Model) developed by KAIST based the actual data of roads and vehicles data in Seoul.

### M.S. in Computer & Information Communication Engineering
**Konkuk University**, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)
2008 – 2010
**Thesis:** Conformance Testing Framework for Automotive Software
**Abstract:** Component based automotive software are becoming more and more popular to develop automotive software. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is the automotive software standard which support component based automotive software for flexibility, reliability, etc. In this work, we present a test framework called ACT (AUTOSAR Conformance Test) framework. ACT framework includes test architecture and test case management tool for developing and managing conformance test cases of automotive software.

### B.S. in Computer Engineering  
**Konkuk University**, Seoul, Republic of Korea (South Korea)
2001 – 2008
