# Portfolio

This portfolio presents selected research and engineering projects that support
the claims made in my academic CV. The focus is on system architecture, technical
decision-making, and empirical validation rather than product promotion.

## 1. Historical GIS Mapping Using Early 20th-Century Maps

This project explores how historical cartographic materials can be transformed
into analyzable digital maps despite incomplete or inconsistent source data.

- Location reconstruction using historical documents and spatial inference
- PostgreSQL-based spatial data modeling
- OpenStreetMap basemap integration and Leaflet.js visualization
- Methodological discussion on uncertainty in historical GIS
