## Overview

**IDE Style Three Panel Theme** is a Jekyll theme inspired by the classic  
**three-panel layout of modern IDEs** such as VS Code, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.

The layout is optimized for documentation-heavy and text-centric websites:

- **Left panel**: Global navigation
- **Center panel**: Content list
- **Right panel**: Content viewer

It is designed for developers, researchers, and writers who treat their website as a long-term working space rather than a feed-style blog.

## Layout Structure

```

└─────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

## Design Philosophy

> Writing is not disposable content —  
> it is accumulated work.

This theme is not built for social-media-style consumption.  
It is designed as a **persistent workspace**, much like an IDE.
